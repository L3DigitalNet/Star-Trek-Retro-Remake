# Complete Feature Branch Merge Process

Execute the complete process for merging a feature branch into the main branch of the PySide6 MVVM desktop application repository, including preparation, validation, and integration.

## Overview

This prompt guides you through the entire merge workflow:

1. **Pre-merge preparation and validation**
2. **Final testing and documentation updates**
3. **Merge execution and verification**
4. **Post-merge cleanup and validation**

## Phase 1: Pre-Merge Preparation

### Step 1: Architecture and Code Quality Review

**MVVM Architecture Validation:**

- [ ] **Model Layer**: No Qt imports, pure business logic only
- [ ] **ViewModel Layer**: QObject-based, proper signal/slot usage
- [ ] **View Layer**: UI-only concerns, minimal logic
- [ ] **Service Layer**: External integrations properly abstracted
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Used throughout, no hardcoded dependencies
- [ ] **SOLID Principles**: All principles maintained across layers

**Code Standards Check:**

```bash
# Type checking
mypy src/

# Code style and linting
pylint src/ --rcfile=.pylintrc
black --check src/ tests/
isort --check src/ tests/

# Security scan (if configured)
bandit -r src/
```

### Step 2: Comprehensive Testing

**Run Full Test Suite:**

```bash
# All tests with coverage
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/ -v                    # Unit tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v            # Integration tests

# Test specific patterns
pytest -k "viewmodel" tests/ -v         # ViewModel tests
pytest -k "model" tests/ -v             # Model tests
```

**Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] All new features have unit tests (90%+ coverage for ViewModels, 95%+ for Models)
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Qt-specific tests use `pytest-qt` and `qtbot`
- [ ] Mock external dependencies appropriately
- [ ] Test both success and failure paths
- [ ] Edge cases and null-checking scenarios covered

**Known Test Exceptions (Document if applicable):**

If there are intentionally failing tests, document them:

```markdown
### Expected Test Failures

The following tests are expected to fail as part of the current design:

1. `test_handle_x_without_y` - Deferred error handling for v1.0.0
2. `test_validation_edge_case` - Confident design pattern in use
3. `test_null_check_scenario` - Future v1.0.0 requirement

**Status:** Documented design decisions per project guidelines
**Action:** None required for merge
```

### Step 3: Documentation and Changelog

**Documentation Updates:**

- [ ] **README.md**: Updated with new features/changes
- [ ] **AGENTS.md**: Updated if architecture patterns changed
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Docstrings added for all public methods/classes
- [ ] **Type Hints**: Present and accurate on all functions/methods

**Changelog Update:**

```bash
# Update CHANGELOG.md with semantic versioning
# Example format:

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New ViewModel for [feature] with reactive data binding
- Service layer implementation for [external integration]

```

### Step 4: Merge Conflict Resolution

**Sync with Main Branch:**

```bash
# Fetch latest main
git fetch origin main

# Check for conflicts
git merge-base HEAD origin/main
git diff origin/main...HEAD

# Rebase onto main if needed
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur, resolve them:
# 1. Edit conflicted files
# 2. git add <resolved-files>
# 3. git rebase --continue
# 4. Re-run tests after resolution
```

**Post-Rebase Validation:**

```bash
# Ensure tests still pass after rebase
pytest tests/ -v

# Verify application starts correctly
python src/main.py --version  # or appropriate test command
```

## Phase 2: Merge Execution

### Step 5: Final Pre-Merge Validation

**Current Status Check:**

```bash
# Verify clean working directory
git status
git branch --show-current

# Verify all changes committed
git diff --cached
git diff HEAD

# Confirm branch and commit history
git log --oneline -10
```

**Prerequisites Verification:**

- [ ] Currently on feature/testing branch
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] All tests passing (with documented exceptions)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Changelog reflects all changes
- [ ] No merge conflicts with main
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

### Step 6: Execute Merge

**Commit Final Changes (if any):**

```bash
# If there are any uncommitted changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: final merge preparation updates

- Updated documentation
- Resolved merge conflicts
- Finalized test coverage"
```

**Push Feature Branch:**

```bash
# Ensure remote branch is current
git push origin feature-branch-name

# Verify push successful
git status
```

**Switch to Main and Merge:**

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Choose merge strategy based on project preference:
```

**Option A: Merge Commit (Preserves Development History):**

```bash
git merge feature-branch-name --no-ff -m "Merge feature: [descriptive name]

### Step 7: Push and Verify Merge

**Push Merged Main Branch:**

```bash
# Push updated main branch
git push origin main

# Verify push successful
git log --oneline -5
git diff origin/main~1..HEAD  # Should show no differences
```

**Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Verify merge integrity
git show --stat HEAD  # Show merge commit details
git log --graph --oneline -10  # Visualize commit history

# Confirm file changes
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only  # List changed files
git diff HEAD~1 --stat       # Show change statistics
```

## Phase 3: Post-Merge Validation

### Step 8: Post-Merge Testing

**Test Main Branch:**

```bash
# Switch to main and test
git checkout main

# Run full test suite on main
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src

# Test application startup
python src/main.py

# Run any additional integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

**Performance and Regression Testing:**

```bash
# If performance tests exist
pytest tests/performance/ -v

# Memory usage check (if applicable)
python -m memory_profiler src/main.py

# Run stress tests for new features
pytest tests/stress/ -v  # if configured
```

### Step 9: Branch Management

**Clean Up Feature Branch (Optional):**

```bash
# Delete local feature branch (if no longer needed)
git branch -d feature-branch-name

# Delete remote feature branch (if no longer needed)
git push origin --delete feature-branch-name
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Only delete branches if you're certain they're no longer needed. For testing branches, consider keeping them for ongoing development.

**Update Development Branch (if applicable):**

```bash
# If using a persistent testing/development branch
git checkout testing
git merge main  # Sync testing with main
git push origin testing
```

### Step 10: Final Documentation and Communication

**Update Project Status:**

- [ ] Update project version in `pyproject.toml` or `__init__.py`
- [ ] Tag release if this represents a version milestone:

```bash
# Create version tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release version 0.1.0

- Implemented [major features]
- Enhanced [existing capabilities]
- Added comprehensive test coverage
- Updated documentation and guidelines"

git push origin v0.1.0
```

**Team Communication:**

- [ ] Notify team of successful merge
- [ ] Update project management tools (Jira, GitHub Projects, etc.)
- [ ] Document any post-merge tasks or follow-up items
- [ ] Update CI/CD status if applicable

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (Before Push)

If issues discovered before pushing to remote:

```bash
# Undo merge commit (before push)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Alternative: revert specific changes
git checkout HEAD~1 -- path/to/problematic/file
git commit -m "revert: undo problematic changes"
```

### Emergency Rollback (After Push)

If issues discovered after pushing to remote:

```bash
# Option 1: Create revert commit (recommended)
git revert -m 1 HEAD
git push origin main

# Option 2: Hard reset (requires coordination)
git reset --hard <commit-hash-before-merge>
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

**⚠️ Critical:** Coordinate with team before force-pushing. Use revert commits when possible.
